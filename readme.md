I wanted an easy-to-remember domain on the internet that I could link to when referencing the WTFPL.

So I set up [wtfpl2.com](http://wtfpl2.com)!

I'm no website designer.  If you want to make the HTML a bit more correct, or get the page to look right in IE, pull requests are very welcome.

Oh, and uh... in case you couldn't guess... this project is licensed under the WTFPL.
