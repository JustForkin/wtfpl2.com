The WTFPL is my favorite license for releasing copyrighted material.

I wanted an easy-to-remember domain on the internet that I could link to when referencing the WTFPL.

So I set up [wtfpl2.com](http://wtfpl2.com)!  And thanks to the owner of the wtfpl.com domain, [Chris Atkinson](http://chrisacky.com/), you can link to the license via [that url](http://wtfpl.com) as well!

I'm no website designer.  If you want to make the HTML a bit more correct, or get the page to look right in IE, pull requests are very welcome.

Oh, and uh... in case you couldn't guess... this project is licensed under the WTFPL.
